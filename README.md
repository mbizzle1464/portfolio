### About

I am the Loyalty Retention Manager for Studio Movie Grillâ€™s Home Office. My main responsibility within the Support office is the development, strategy, and evolution of our loyalty program. I am also in charge of the execution of all email campaigns and utilizing analtyics to drive future purchasing behavior.

I am currently enrolled into Southern Methodist University's Programming Bootcamp which teaches multiple languages including but not limited to: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, Node.js, Java, Express.js, React.js, Database Theory, Bookshelf.js, MongoDB, MySQL, Command Line, and Git. I absolutely love working with code and I try to build something new everyday! My ultimate goal is to incorporate these new skills with my past experience to continue my growth as a marketing professional.

I graduated from Oklahoma State University with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Political Science in 2009 and moved to Dallas, TX in 2012. In 2014, I married the love of my life, Corinne. We have two beautiful dogs, Lilly and Penny. In our sparetime, we enjoy the company of our family, friends, and occassionally a good glass of red.
